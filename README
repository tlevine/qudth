Qudth randomly samples the lines within a large file and calculates statistics
about each line. For example, in a 10-gigabyte text file, you might want to know
how long a typical line is.

::

    $ qudth qudth/cli.py -n 5 --bins 8
    
    ▁ ▁ ▂ ▁ ▁ ▁ ▃ ▃
    01     52     59
    Lengths of 5 lines in qudth/cli.py
    (simple random sample with replacement)

``wc -l`` is equivalent to qudth, but qudth's sampling makes it much faster
on large files. ``big-file.csv`` is 1 gigabyte in size. ::

    _:~ t$ time qudth big-file.csv > /dev/null

    real    0m0.287s
    user    0m0.161s
    sys     0m0.032s
    _:~ t$ time wc -l big-file.csv > /dev/null

    real    0m2.515s
